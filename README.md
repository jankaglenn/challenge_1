# challenge_1
The purpose of this campaign was focused on the result of outcome of the crowdfunding campaigns data provided between years of 2010-2020 based on number of backers with fulfilling their goals in USA, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Italy, GB and Switzerland.
Based on the results we can determine the results are not truth worthy as the data are outdated and not specific. 
The data was populated from only 7 countries and collected prior to pandemic Covid 19. Covid had a significant influence on many trends. 
We are not aware of backers, if they were individuals or businesses. If they were non-profit, matching the results, if we had extremely large donations or there were purchased based on a flat fee tickets. We don’t know if any of the campaigns were supported by some influencers who promoted the campaign.


•	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
Based on the limited data we were able to analyze that the “Theater” parent category is the largest category, specifically in sub-category “Plays”, where this sub-category “Plays” was at the same time a failure based on the results of Successful and Failed outcome. The “Journalism” (audio and world music) is the least popular campaign but with 100% success.
Categories “Food” and “Games” have similar results. 
The months of June and July are the busiest months of donating for success, where moth August has the most canceled campaigns and second most failed campaigns.
The most donated campaigns are between 1000 to 9999 in currency of the country campaign being held. Campaigns between 10000 to 49999 have tendency to fail or to be canceled. But campaigns with donations over 50000 are successful up to 37% with failure of 53%. We don’t know how much was the greatest donation based on the filter. 




•	What are some limitations of this dataset?
We don’t know more details about the data. How were the campaigns being promoted, advertised. Social media, TV, pop up widows, some events. The data are from the pre covid era, as we know nowadays, social trends have been drastically changed. We don’t know any demographic information regarding the backers. Even though we know the origin of country, we don’t know what state or territory was being a bigger influence or vice versa. There would be most likely outliner between Alaska and California, or New York and New South Wales comparing to Central Australia territories in Australia. 

Age, gender, area of living, lifestyle are big factors that need to be included. Therefore outliners play a significant function within this data analyst worksheet. 
•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
A visualization of Percent Funded would be very beneficial as we would have been able to see the success of funding. 
We could have pulled data comparing months of successful and failed campaigns for Northern and Southern Hemisphere and see if season of the year has any effect on campaigns results. We could just simple create a pivot table and filter the countries by the months. Putting the results into a Line Chart could also reveal if there is any effect of returning back to school. In USA school typically starts in August, in Europe it is September/October.
Based on the results regards the donations, we could have added addition measurement as we see we have received suddenly too many donations over 50000. Maybe add additional filter for 50k-100k.


•	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
Median is able to provide more beneficial data. Average without outliners doesn’t fulfill satisfaction of this campaign. The results of successful campaigns are Median (201) and Mean (851). It is clearly tremendous. We can easily spot it in failed campaigns also with Median (115) and Mean (586). 
As I have stated previously, outliners are necessary here, with Minimum 16 and Maximum over 7000 in successful and Minimum zero with Maximum 6080 in failed ones. 


•	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
Successful campaign wins over failed by 35%. There is a significant variability in successful outcome based on results for parent-categories “Audio”, and “World Music” as both of the categories are 100% succesfull.
